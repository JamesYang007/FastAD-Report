\section{Further Studies}

FastAD is still quite new and 
does not have full support for all commonly-used functions
and probability density functions.
While FastAD is currently optimized for CPU performance,
its design can be extended to support GPU.\@
Having support for both processors will allow FastAD
to be well-suited for extremely large-scale problems as well.
Lastly, one application that could potentially benefit greatly from FastAD 
is probabilistic programming language such as Stan,
which heavily uses automatic differentiation for differentiating scalar functions.

\subsection{Class Var}

We briefly mention a wrapper class of \verb|VarView| called \verb|Var|.
If the user does not need such fine control of memory as described in Section~\ref{ssec:var_view},
they can use \verb|Var|, which will internally allocate memory for its values and adjoints at construction.
The following is a simplified definition for scalar shapes:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customcpp]
template <class ValueType>
struct Var<ValueType, scl>: VarView<ValueType, scl>
{
    Var()
        : base_t(&val_, &adj_) 
        , val_(0)
        , adj_(0)
    {}
private:
    value_t val_;
    value_t adj_;
};
\end{lstlisting}
Note that \verb|Var| inherits from \verb|VarView| and 
it is not an AD expression since it does not derive from \verb|ExprBase|.
This is a deliberate design choice and will be discussed further in Section~\ref{ssec:unary}.
At construction, the base class \verb|VarView| 
views the memory for the values and adjoints allocated in \verb|Var|.

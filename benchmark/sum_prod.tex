        Sum and product benchmarks of other libraries against FastAD 
        plotted relative to FastAD average time.
        Fig.~\ref{fig:sum},\ref{fig:prod} use built-in functions whenever available.
        Fig.~\ref{fig:sum_iter},\ref{fig:prod_iter} use the naive iterative-based code for all libraries.

The summation function is defined as $f_s:\R^n \to \R$ where~$f_s(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i$,
and the product function is defined as $f_p:\R^n \to \R$ where~$f_p(x) = \prod\limits_{i=1}^n x_i$.
We also tested the case where we forced all libraries to use a manually-written for-loop-based summation and product.
Fig.~\ref{fig:sum_prod} shows the benchmark results.

In all four cases, it is clear that FastAD outperforms all libraries for all values of $N$
by a significant factor.
For \code{sum}, 
the next three fastest libraries, asymptotically, are Adept, Stan, and CppAD, respectively.
The trend stabilizes starting from $N=2^6=64$ where Adept is about $ 10$ times slower than
FastAD and Stan about $ 15$ times.
The naive, for-loop-based benchmark shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sum_iter} exhibits a similar pattern,
although the performance difference with FastAD is less extreme:
Adept is about $ 4.5$ times slower
and Stan about $ 6$ times.
Nonetheless, this is still a very notable difference.

For the \code{prod} and \code{prod\_iter} cases, 
Fig.~\ref{fig:prod},\ref{fig:prod_iter} again show
a similar trend as \code{sum} and \code{sum\_iter}.
Overall, the comparison with FastAD is less extreme.
For \code{prod}, Adept is about $ 5$ times slower than FastAD,
and Stan about $ 7$ times.
For \code{prod\_iter}, Adept is about $3$ times slower
and Stan about $4.7$ times.

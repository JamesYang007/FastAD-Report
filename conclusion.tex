\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we first introduced the reverse-mode automatic differentiation algorithm
to give context and background on how FastAD is implemented.
We then discussed how FastAD uses vectorization to boost the overall performance, 
expression template and lazy allocation strategies to simplify memory management,
and compile-time checks to further reduce run-time.\
To see how FastAD performs in practice, we rigorously benchmarked 
a set of micro and macro-benchmarks
with other popular C++ AD libraries and showed that FastAD consistently achieved
2 to 19 times faster speed than the next two fastest libraries across a wide range of examples.

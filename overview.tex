\section{Overview}

Section~\ref{sec:reverse} will first explain the reverse-mode automatic differentiation algorithm
to give context for how FastAD is implemented.
With this background, Section~\ref{sec:fastad} will discuss some implementation detail
and draw design comparisons with other libraries 
to see how FastAD overcomes the common challenges seen in these libraries.
In Section~\ref{sec:benchmark}, we show a series of benchmarks with
other libraries including two real-world examples 
of a regression model and a stochastic volatility model.

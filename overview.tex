\section{Overview}

Section~\ref{sec:reverse} will first explain the reverse-mode automatic differentation
to give context of how FastAD is implemented.
With this background, Section~\ref{sec:fastad} will introduce the ideas:
vectorization, lazy-evaluation, and lazy-allocation and explain why these
ideas are useful in the context of AD to motivate our design for FastAD.
In Section~\ref{sec:benchmark}, we show a series of benchmarks with
other AD libraries including two real-world examples 
of a regression model and a stochastic volatility model.
Section~\ref{sec:related} concludes the paper with final remarks on
the design differences between FastAD and other libraries.

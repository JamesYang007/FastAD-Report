\section{FastAD Implementation}\label{sec:fastad}

In this section, we cover a few key ideas of our implementation\footnotemark.
\footnotetext{github page: https://github.com/JamesYang007/FastAD}
In Section~\ref{ssec:vectorization},
we first discuss the benefits of vectorization and the difficulties of integrating it into an AD system.
We then explain how FastAD fully utilizes vectorization
and demonstrate that other libraries do not fully take advantage of it. 
In Section~\ref{ssec:memory},
we discuss some memory management and performance issues
stemming from the use of the ``tape'' data structure.
We then explain how FastAD overcomes these challenges using expression templates
and a lazy allocation strategy.\@
Finally, Section~\ref{ssec:compile-time-opt} covers other compile-time optimizations 
that can further maximize performance.

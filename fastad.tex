\section{FastAD Implementation}

In this section, we cover some of the key ideas of our implementation.
In Section~\ref{ssec:example}, we first show an example program using FastAD
to get an intuition for how the library works.
Section~\ref{ssec:motivation} motivates our design choices with desirable end-goals
from a performance perspective such as vectorization, lazy-evaluation, and lazy-allocation,
describing in detail what these strategies are,
why they are useful in the context of automatic differentiation,
and how they can be achieved.
Sections~\ref{ssec:expression_template}-\ref{ssec:glue_node} explore the most essential classes
used to build an expression tree.
We explore exactly where vectorization, lazy-evaluation, and lazy-allocation occurs.
Finally, Section~\ref{ssec:normal_log_pdf} covers our implementation of
Normal log-pdf, one of the special nodes that can be further optimized to maximize performance.

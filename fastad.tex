\section{FastAD Implementation}\label{sec:fastad}

In this section, we cover some of the key ideas of our implementation.
In Section~\ref{ssec:example}, we show an example program using FastAD
differentiating Eq.~\ref{eq:f-example} to get an intuition for how the library works.
Section~\ref{ssec:motivation} motivates our design choices with desirable end-goals
from a performance perspective such as vectorization, lazy-evaluation, and lazy-allocation,
describing in detail what these strategies are,
why they are useful in the context of automatic differentiation,
and how they can be achieved.
Sections~\ref{ssec:value_view}-\ref{ssec:eq} explore the most essential classes
used to build an expression tree.
Further, we explore exactly where vectorization, lazy-evaluation, and lazy-allocation occur.
Finally, Section~\ref{ssec:normal_log_pdf} covers our implementation of
Normal log-pdf to demonstrate how compile-time optimizations 
can further maximize performance.
